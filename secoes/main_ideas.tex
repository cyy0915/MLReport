\section{Main Ideas}
Image classification challenge has been one of the most-discussed problems in the past decades. However, better and better network structures have been found, whose accuracy on natural image classification has risen to an extent of general satisfactory among almost all datasets, except for medical segmentation tasks. Medical image segmentation is still challenging because of its importance as a nature and its commitment for finding tiny structures which could affect diagnosis results.\\

Some Challenges have been asking for better methods for medical image segmentation, like ISBI. During the search for domain-specific networks, we noted that there are three networks in a series all belonging to the U-Net school, which, seen in a row, can uncover the progress the field very well. These methods are: U-Net, UNet++ and UNet+++.\\

We did experiments on these methods with the provided ISBI dataset, compared the procedure of leveraging all these methods and listed the performances of all. Although all three methods are all implemented on different machines with different calculation capacities, the experiments could still uncover some interesting traits among all these methods. The results of all methods show that UNet+++ performs best, with an accuracy of 0.923, with U-Net following it at 0.919, and UNet++ ranking the worst at 0.917. We also did more comparison in the final section.
