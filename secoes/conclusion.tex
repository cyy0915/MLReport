\section{Conclusion}
In the project, we study the deep learning network UNet, UNet++ and UNet+++, and implement all three network on the given dataset.
The experiments on the three network show lots of information. First, all experiments get relatively high accuracy on test data, which means that UNet and its variants work well in image segmentation.
Second, these network can converge quickly. In the training process, Although the given training dataset is not big(25 images), the accuracy reaches highest when iterate for about 20 times, a relatively small value.
Third, the modification for Unet in other two networks improve the network performance, especially UNet+++. The best accuracy of UNet and UNet++ is approximately 0.918, and that of UNet+++ can be 0.923, a impovement of 0.5\%.

In conclusion, we learn a lot from the project. We get a better understand of image segmentation and deep learning. 
However, Because of time limit and device limit, our experiments lack further optimization on some parameter, so the accuracy in some experiments above can be higher. We may refine it in the futrue.
